    <h1>This is giving information of git and github</h1>
    <p>Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase,
         collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects. 
         It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to help manage the development of the Linux kernel.</p>
    <p>GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories, as well as additional features such as issue tracking, project management, 
        and collaboration tools. GitHub was founded in 2008 and has since become one of the most popular platforms for open-source and
         private software development.</p>
